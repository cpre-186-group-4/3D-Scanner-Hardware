# 3D-Scanner-Hardware
A repository for all CAD documents and any files related to the the hardware for the 3D scanner designed in CprE 186.


## Hardware Overview

The goal of the project within this repository is to create a specialized Raspberry Pi case
designed to contain extra components necessary to create an open-source, wireless 3D scanner
based on our group project for Computer Engineering 186 at Iowa State University.

The hardware used for this project as well as their sources are listed below. Please note that some of :

* Raspberry Pi Zero W - $10
	
	Source: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400
	
	Specifications: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/rpi_MECH_Zero_1p3.pdf

* BerryGPS-IMUv3 - $50
	
	Source: https://www.amazon.com/BerryGPS-IMUv2-Raspberry-Accelerometer-Magnetometer-Barometric/dp/B072MNBC9M/ref=asc_df_B072MNBC9M/
	
	Specifications: not found! But it's close enough to the Pi 0 that they could be the same dimensions

* Raspberry Picamera v2 - $25
	
	Source: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3099
	
	Specifications: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/camera/mechanical/rpi_MECH_Camera2_2p1.pdf

* Raspberry Pi 0 Camera Cable - $5
	
	Source: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3157
	
	It's best to leave cables out of a simple CAD project

* SanDisk Ultra 8GB Micro SD - $7
	
	Source: https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSDHC-Standard-Packaging-SDSDQUAN-008G-G4A/dp/B00M55C0VU
	
	Just about any legit 8GB+ Micro SD card works too. Not necessary to CAD

* 4400 mAh Lithium Ion Battery Pack - $20
	
	Source: https://www.adafruit.com/product/354
	
	Specifications: pretty much a box with dimensions 69mm x 37mm x 18mm. Make sure to leave a hole in the top middle for the cable though!
